#Rasperry Pi OS

Operating system built from scratch for the Raspberry Pi written in ARMv6 assembly. For personal learning purposes.  
  
If you want to run it for whatever reason, I have only tested it on the Model B Raspberry Pi.  
  
- run "make"
- Put in RPi SD Card into computer, navigate to /boot folder  
- rename kernel.img to kernel-std.img (you can choose any name)  
- copy the kernel.img from "make" to boot folder on SD Card.  
- Plug in SD Card to RPi and turn it on.
